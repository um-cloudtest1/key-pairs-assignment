We are going to use GitHub classroom for assignment submissions.
While the website https://www.billmongan.com/posts/2020/02/githubclassroom/
is directed toward teachers, it will give you a good idea of the advantages
and workflow of Github classroom.

We will assume that the system that you are working on has a git client installed.
You can download Git for Windows at https://git-scm.com/download/win which will
enable you to use git commands in Windows PowerShell.  If you are working on a Mac,
if you try to run git by typing "git --version", your system will prompt you to 
install it.  On Linux, git is probably already installed, but if not, on Ubuntu do
"sudo apt install git-all" and on Centos/Fedora do "sudo dnf install git-all".

You should already have a GitHub account.  If not, go to https://github.com and build one.
To do the Moodle part of the first assignment, submit the identifier and the e-mail for
your GitHub account.

Please join the organization "UM-cloud-computing".  [Fred: I may need to invite all
students to join this organization.  You are not currently a member, so try this out
without being a member.]

To get the GitHub part of the first assignment, click on 
https://classroom.github.com/a/3Ll_Zqz1.  You will be asked to identify with your e-mail 
address in the GitHub roster.  When your github account is linked to the classroom,
you will get your version of the repsository for this account.  Read the "README.md"
file to get the details of the assignment.
